When it do that, then it get very noisy because the noise is coming from that opening.\\n\\nWhen I go to the dealer to tell them about this concern (because when I bought it 2 months ago it didn't do that) they said that it was NORMAL!!!! :mad: ....... And I said that it is not normal because that problem started just a few days ago (I can't believe they didn't try to find a solution for the problem)\\n\\nI think I did everything I could. They told me that they can not do anything right now because the car is brand new and there are no specifications about that kind of problems.\\n\\nI would like to know if someone is experiencing this or experienced it already and got it fixed and how.\\n\\nThank you very much !!!!\\n\\n~Claudette\""
